# Lenani Dream Interpretation

**Description**
A plugin for dream interpretation

## Backend
The plugin creates custom post type which shows up in admin menu on dashboard WP.
On `Edit Post`or `Add Post` page the featured image is enabled (your theme must accept/support Featured Image feature).
Interpretation of the dreams can be added manually like any other post or article. Use tags.

## Frontend

Create a post or a page and add the shortcode ```[lenani_dream_search]``` to display the smart-search option.




## Issues
 * search functionality is displaying results but the ```excerpt``` is showing *undefined* even if there are text-based content added for each dream interpretation
 * search by tags not working

## In development
 * better filtering of the tags and display results
 * additional css
 * translation ready

## Should 
 * admin should be able to add/create unlimited number of dream interpretations, set to display only 10 or 15 per page and add pagination
 * ability to display tags or categories of dream interpretations
